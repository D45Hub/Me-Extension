Hey you... Yes you. üëÄ

When you go about whatever you might be doing in your life...
Do you stumble upon this one person which is a bit too egocentric from time to time?

No? *Come on... Just let me make this transition for once...*

Still no? ü§î
You are looking at the source code of an obscure browser extension. 
Just look at the pull requests of that one popular project which is getting recommended next to this one.

Whoever this person may be... 
I've got **the** solution for you.

Let me present to you. The **Me-Extension**. *If you've got a better name idea... Please tell me. I'm a developer not a marketer.*
This exquisite piece of browser extension goodness allows you to mark those with that extra bit of egocentricism or "me"-ness. *Or whatever you might want to call it.*

Why does this even exist? Just because. *well...* üòÖ

Simple. Short. For you. By **me**.

Enjoy. ‚ù§
